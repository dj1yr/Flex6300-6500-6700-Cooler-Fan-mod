Here I provide an alternative cooler for the Flex 6300/6500 and 6700.
I am using a 45mm Delta frameless fan with the designation EFB0512HHAFAH.
The fan is attached to the cooler with 3x M2x4 screws, the cooler is glued to the FPGA and the CPU with thermal adhesive.

I had the cooler manufactured by JLPCB, the price was just under 30€ per cooler for the production of 2 pieces and the fans cost 14€/piece.
